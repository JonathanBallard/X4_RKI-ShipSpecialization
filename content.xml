RKI-ShipSpecialization (RKI-SS) organizes some hand-picked small ships into specialized classes, including 2 newly created classes of light reconnaissance ship: Vedettes and Scanners. These ships then receive enhancements ranging from moderate to superb, based on the designated roles of their new classification. Several QoL changes have been included as well. RKI-SS is intended to be used together with the incredible [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/x4foundations/mods/305]Variety and Rebalance Overhaul (VRO)[/url], which was created by [b]Shuul[/b]. ShipSpecialization changes will also be applied to appropriate ships from some/all/none of the recommended mods, based on whether you install that mod. No additional mods are required. However, RKI-SS DOES REQUIRE 3 Egosoft DLC's (Split Vendetta, Cradle of Humanity, and Tides of Avarice).
