RKI-ShipSpecialization (RKI-SS) organizes some hand-picked small ships into specialized classes, creates 5 new ships in 2 newly created light reconnaissance classes: Vedettes and Scanners. Several QoL changes have been included as well. All features are balanced for VRO. RKI-SS is intended to be used together with the incredible Variety and Rebalance Overhaul (VRO), which was created by Shuul. ShipSpecialization changes will also be applied to appropriate ships from some/all/none of the recommended mods, based on whether you install that mod. RKI-SS REQUIRES the VRO Icons Expanded Mod, since I use some of the new icons in the new ships. &#13;&#10;

Required Mods (RKI-SS might work without these, but I haven't tested it nor will I support it):  &#13;&#10;
- Variety and Rebalance Overhaul Icon Pack: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2007185841 &#13;&#10;
- The 3 Egosoft DLC's (Split Vendetta, Cradle of Humanity, and Tides of Avarice).  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;

&#13;&#10;

Recommended Mods:&#13;&#10;
- Variety and Rebalance Overhaul (AKA VRO): https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1696862840 - HIGHLY recommended (all changes are balanced against VRO, mod is unsupported without this, but should work fine)&#13;&#10;
- Bayamon Miner - VRO Version: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2647877221 &#13;&#10;
- ATFUSC Shippack - VRO Version: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2627959637 &#13;&#10;
- Ship Variation Expansion - Vanilla: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2229061492 - Use with the VRO version below&#13;&#10;
- Ship Variation Expansion - VRO: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2551053441 - Requires the Vanilla version of SVE which is linked above &#13;&#10;

Remember to always backup your savegames. Removing this mod mid-save may cause issues because I have added new ships. If you might want to remove this mod, backup your save, then to remove, destroy all of the ships I add in this mod (the AI won't build them, but if the AI have any, you'll need to destroy those as well I believe), backup AGAIN (never too many backups), then disable the mod.
